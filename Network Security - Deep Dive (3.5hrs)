    ARP poisoning (attacker's MAC is the victim's default gateway)
                    ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is a protocol used in computer 
                    networking to map a network address (such as an IP address)
                    to a physical address (such as a Media Access Control (MAC) address).
    Rogue DHCP (attackers DHCP server tells the victim that the IP address of the default gateway is the attacker's IP address)    Yersinia
                    DHCP DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a network management protocol used to automatically 
                    assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters, such as subnet mask, default gateway, 
                    and DNS server addresses, to devices on a network. DHCP eliminates the need for network administrators 
                    to manually assign IP addresses to devices, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.

                    When a device connects to a network that uses DHCP, it sends a broadcast message requesting network configuration information. 
                    A DHCP server on the network receives the message and assigns the device an available IP address and other configuration parameters. 
                    The DHCP server maintains a pool of available IP addresses and leases them to devices for a specified period of time, called the lease time. When a device's lease expires, it can request a new lease from the DHCP server. If the DHCP server is unavailable, 
                    devices can continue to use their assigned IP addresses and other configuration parameters for a period of time, called the grace period.
