Components
Vault: Secure storage for sensitive information.

PVWA (Password Vault Web Access): Web interface for managing credentials.

CPM (Central Policy Manager): Manages password policies and rotation.

PSM (Privileged Session Manager): Monitors and records privileged sessions.

PTA (Privileged Threat Analytics): Analyzes user behavior for anomalies.

Key Concepts
Safe: A container for storing credentials, secrets, and sensitive files.

Account: Represents a privileged credential (e.g., username and password).

Policy: Defines rules for password management, including rotation frequency.

Best Practices
Regularly Rotate Passwords: Ensure policies are in place for automatic password rotation.

Limit Access: Follow the principle of least privilege for users accessing the vault.
